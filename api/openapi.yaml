    # Overview

    ## Authentication

    LaunchDarkly's REST API uses the HTTPS protocol with a minimum TLS version of 1.2.

    All REST API resources are authenticated with either [personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens), or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can manage personal access tokens on your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.

    LaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that are used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and JavaScript-based SDKs, respectively. **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These keys are environment-specific, and can only perform read-only operations such as fetching feature flag settings.

    > #### Keep your access tokens and SDK keys private
    >
    > Access tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts. Never put an access token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile application. LaunchDarkly has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile apps. If you accidentally expose an access token or SDK key, you can reset it from your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.
    >
    > The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's designed for use in client-side JavaScript.

    ### Authentication using request header

    The preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization` header containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization` header must be your access token.

    Manage personal access tokens from the [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.

    ### Authentication using session cookie

    For testing purposes, you can make API calls directly from your web browser. If you are logged in to the LaunchDarkly application, the API will use your existing session to authenticate calls.

    If you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles) other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles) defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive a `401` response code in that case.

    > ### Modifying the Origin header causes an error
    >
    > LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.
    >
    > If the Origin header does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.
    >
    > Any browser extension that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example, the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.
    >
    > To prevent this error, do not modify your Origin header.
    >
    > LaunchDarkly does not require origin matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect normal API usage.

    ## Representations

    All resources expect and return JSON response bodies. Error responses also send a JSON body. To learn more about the error format of the API, read [Errors](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

    In practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

    In addition, request bodies for `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

    ### Summary and detailed representations

    When you fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important attributes of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource. When you fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive a _detailed representation_ of the resource.

    The best way to find a detailed representation is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link to its detailed representation.

    ### Expanding responses

    Sometimes the detailed representation of a resource does not include all of the attributes of the resource by default. If this is the case, the request method will clearly document this and describe which attributes you can include in an expanded response.

    To include the additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter to your request and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include. For example, when you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.

    ### Links and addressability

    The best way to navigate the API is by following links. These are attributes in representations that link to other resources. The API always uses the same format for links:

    - Links to other resources within the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object
    - If the resource has a corresponding link to HTML content on the site, it is stored in a special `_site` link

    Each link has two attributes:

    - An `href`, which contains the URL
    - A `type`, which describes the content type

    For example, a feature resource might return the following:

    ```json
    {
      "_links": {
        "parent": {
          "href": "/api/features",
          "type": "application/json"
        },
        "self": {
          "href": "/api/features/sort.order",
          "type": "application/json"
        }
      },
      "_site": {
        "href": "/features/sort.order",
        "type": "text/html"
      }
    }
    ```

    From this, you can navigate to the parent collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site page for the feature by following the `_site` link.

    Collections are always represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined at the top level.

    Paginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`, and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the collection.

    ## Updates

    Resources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH` verb. Most resources support the [JSON patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) format. Some resources also support the [JSON merge patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) format, and some resources support the [semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) format, which is a way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable instructions. Each resource supports optional [comments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) that you can submit with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the audit log, and other integrations.

    When a resource supports both JSON patch and semantic patch, we document both in the request method. However, the specific request body fields and descriptions included in our documentation only match one type of patch or the other.

    ### Updates using JSON patch

    [JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses paths and a limited set of operations to describe how to transform the current state of the resource into a new state. JSON patch documents are always arrays, where each element contains an operation, a path to the field to update, and the new value.

    For example, in this feature flag representation:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "New recommendations engine",
        "key": "engine.enable",
        "description": "This is the description",
        ...
    }
    ```
    You can change the feature flag's description with the following patch document:

    ```json
    [{ "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "This is the new description" }]
    ```

    You can specify multiple modifications to perform in a single request. You can also test that certain preconditions are met before applying the patch:

    ```json
    [
      { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 10 },
      { "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "The new description" }
    ]
    ```

    The above patch request tests whether the feature flag's `version` is `10`, and if so, changes the feature flag's description.

    Attributes that are not editable, such as a resource's `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.

    ### Updates using JSON merge patch

    [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) is another format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON merge patch is less expressive than JSON patch. However, in many cases it is simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change a feature flag's description with the following merge patch document:

    ```json
    {
      "description": "New flag description"
    }
    ```

    ### Updates using semantic patch

    Some resources support the semantic patch format. A semantic patch is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable instructions.

    Semantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using precise, custom instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when defining a change that may be applied at a future date.

    To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.

    Here's how:

    ```
    Content-Type: application/json; domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch
    ```

    If you call a semantic patch resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.

    The body of a semantic patch request takes the following properties:

    * `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.
    * `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some resources only) The environment key.
    * `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the instruction requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object. The documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch includes the available instructions and any additional parameters.

    For example:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "optional comment",
      "instructions": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOn"} ]
    }
    ```

    If any instruction in the patch encounters an error, the endpoint returns an error and will not change the resource. In general, each instruction silently does nothing if the resource is already in the state you request.

    ### Updates with comments

    You can submit optional comments with `PATCH` changes.

    To submit a comment along with a JSON patch document, use the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "patch": [{ "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "The new description" }]
    }
    ```

    To submit a comment along with a JSON merge patch document, use the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "merge": { "description": "New flag description" }
    }
    ```

    To submit a comment along with a semantic patch, use the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "instructions": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOn"} ]
    }
    ```

    ## Errors

    The API always returns errors in a common format. Here's an example:

    ```json
    {
      "code": "invalid_request",
      "message": "A feature with that key already exists",
      "id": "30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba"
    }
    ```

    The `code` indicates the general class of error. The `message` is a human-readable explanation of what went wrong. The `id` is a unique identifier. Use it when you're working with LaunchDarkly Support to debug a problem with a specific API call.

    ### HTTP status error response codes

    | Code | Definition        | Description                                                                                       | Possible Solution                                                |
    | ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 400  | Invalid request       | The request cannot be understood.                                    | Ensure JSON syntax in request body is correct.                   |
    | 401  | Invalid access token      | Requestor is unauthorized or does not have permission for this API call.                                                | Ensure your API access token is valid and has the appropriate permissions.                                     |
    | 403  | Forbidden         | Requestor does not have access to this resource.                                                | Ensure that the account member or access token has proper permissions set. |
    | 404  | Invalid resource identifier | The requested resource is not valid. | Ensure that the resource is correctly identified by ID or key. |
    | 405  | Method not allowed | The request method is not allowed on this resource. | Ensure that the HTTP verb is correct. |
    | 409  | Conflict          | The API request can not be completed because it conflicts with a concurrent API request. | Retry your request.                                              |
    | 422  | Unprocessable entity | The API request can not be completed because the update description can not be understood. | Ensure that the request body is correct for the type of patch you are using, either JSON patch or semantic patch.
    | 429  | Too many requests | Read [Rate limiting](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).                                               | Wait and try again later.                                        |

    ## CORS

    The LaunchDarkly API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an `Origin` header is given in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed origin. Otherwise the request returns a wildcard, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information on CORS, read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors). Example CORS headers might look like:

    ```http
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 300
    ```

    You can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com). If you are using session authentication, you should set the `withCredentials` property for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access tokens to untrusted entities.

    ## Rate limiting

    We use several rate limiting strategies to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our APIs return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs include headers indicating the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism, and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the headers described below.

    > ### Rate limiting and SDKs
    >
    > LaunchDarkly SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.

    ### Global rate limits

    Authenticated requests are subject to a global limit. This is the maximum number of calls that your account can make to the API per ten seconds. All service and personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to global rate limits may return the headers below:

    | Header name                    | Description                                                                      |
    | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.    |

    We do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limit.

    ### Route-level rate limits

    Some authenticated routes have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any service or personal access tokens hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits return the headers below:

    | Header name                   | Description                                                                                           |
    | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |
    | `X-Ratelimit-Reset`           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.                         |

    A _route_ represents a specific URL pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.

    We do not publicly document the specific number of calls that an account can make to each endpoint per ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limits.

    ### IP-based rate limiting

    We also employ IP-based rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate limit, your API response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After` seconds before making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter and backoff strategies to avoid triggering rate limits again.

    ## OpenAPI (Swagger) and client libraries

    We have a [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json) for our API.

    We auto-generate multiple client libraries based on our OpenAPI specification. To learn more, visit the [collection of client libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories). You can also use this specification to generate client libraries to interact with our REST API in your language of choice.

    Our OpenAPI specification is supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many cases, you can directly import our specification to explore our APIs.

    ## Method overriding

    Some firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of verbs other than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints that use `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` verbs are inaccessible.

    To avoid this issue, our API supports the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients to "tunnel" `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests using a `POST` request.

    For example, to call a `PATCH` endpoint using a `POST` request, you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH` as a header.

    ## Beta resources

    We sometimes release new API resources in **beta** status before we release them with general availability.

    Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.

    We try to promote resources into general availability as quickly as possible. This happens after sufficient testing and when we're satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible changes.

    We mark beta resources with a "Beta" callout in our documentation, pictured below:

    > ### This feature is in beta
    >
    > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).
    >
    > Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.

    ### Using beta resources

    To use a beta resource, you must include a header in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you receive a `403` response.

    Use this header:

    ```
    LD-API-Version: beta
    ```

    ## Federal environments

    The version of LaunchDarkly that is available on domains controlled by the United States government is different from the version of LaunchDarkly available to the general public. If you are an employee or contractor for a United States federal agency and use LaunchDarkly in your work, you likely use the federal instance of LaunchDarkly.

    If you are working in the federal instance of LaunchDarkly, the base URI for each request is `https://app.launchdarkly.us`. In the "Try it" sandbox for each request, click the request path to view the complete resource path for the federal environment.

    To learn more, read [LaunchDarkly in federal environments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/advanced/federal).

    ## Versioning

    We try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't prepare for them accordingly.

    Updates to our REST API include support for the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a new version at your own pace.

    ### Setting the API version per request

    You can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version` header, as shown in the example below:

    ```
    LD-API-Version: 20220603
    ```

    The header value is the version number of the API version you would like to request. The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was released in `yyyymmdd` format. In the example above the version `20220603` corresponds to June 03, 2022.

    ### Setting the API version per access token

    When you create an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use. This ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version changes.

    Tokens created before versioning was released have their version set to `20160426`, which is the version of the API that existed before the current versioning scheme, so that they continue working the same way they did before versioning.

    If you would like to upgrade your integration to use a new API version, you can explicitly set the header described above.

    > ### Best practice: Set the header for every client or integration
    >
    > We recommend that you set the API version header explicitly in any client or integration you build.
    >
    > Only rely on the access token API version during manual testing.

    > ### Synced segments and larger list-based segments are an Enterprise feature
    >
    > This section documents endpoints for rule-based, list-based, and synced segments.
    >
    > A "big segment" is a segment that is either a synced segment, or a list-based segment with more than 15,000 entries that includes only one targeted context kind. LaunchDarkly uses different implementations for different types of segments so that all of your segments have good performance.
    >
    > In the segments API, a big segment is indicated by the `unbounded` field being set to `true`.
    >
    > These segments are available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

    Segments are groups of contexts that you can use to manage flag targeting behavior in bulk. LaunchDarkly supports:

    * rule-based segments, which let you target groups of contexts individually or by attribute,
    * list-based segments, which let you target individual contexts or uploaded lists of contexts, and
    * synced segments, which let you target groups of contexts backed by an external data store.

    To learn more, read [Segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments).

    The segments API allows you to list, create, modify, and delete segments programmatically.

    You can find other APIs for working with big segments under [Segments (beta)](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)) and [Integrations (beta)](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)).
  name: Segments
- description: |
    You can create an approval request that prevents a flag change from being applied without approval from a team member. Select up to ten members as reviewers. Reviewers receive an email notification, but anyone with sufficient permissions can review a pending approval request. A change needs at least one approval before you can apply it. To learn more, read [Approvals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/approvals).

    Changes that conflict will fail if approved and applied, and the flag will not be updated.

    Several of the endpoints in the approvals API require a flag approval request ID. The flag approval request ID is returned as part of the [Create approval request](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [List approval requests for a flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array. If you created the approval request as part of a [workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), you can also use a workflow ID as the approval request ID. The workflow ID is returned as part of the [Create workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Get workflows](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.

    The feature flags API allows you to list, create, modify, and delete feature flags, their statuses, and their expiring targets programmatically. For example, you can control percentage rollouts, target specific contexts, or even toggle off a feature flag programmatically.

    ## Sample feature flag representation

    Every feature flag has a set of top-level attributes, as well as an `environments` map containing the flag rollout and targeting rules specific to each environment. To learn more, read [Using feature flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/creating-flags).

    ## Anatomy of a feature flag

    This section describes the sample feature flag representation in more detail.

    ### Top-level attributes

    Most of the top-level attributes have a straightforward interpretation, for example `name` and `description`.

    The `variations` array represents the different variation values that a feature flag has. For a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers, strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred to by their index into this array.

    To update these attributes, read [Update feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), especially the instructions for **updating flag settings**.

    ### Per-environment configurations

    Each entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in the flag's Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags).

    To update per-environment information for a flag, read [Update feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), especially the instructions for **turning flags on and off** and **working with targeting and variations**.

    ### Individual context targets

    The `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays in the per-environment configuration data correspond to the individual context targeting on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Individual targeting](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/individual-targeting).

    Each object in the `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays represents a list of context keys assigned to a particular variation. The `targets` array includes contexts with `contextKind` of "user" and the `contextTargets` array includes contexts with context kinds other than "user."

    For example:

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "environments" : {
        "production" : {
          ...
          "targets": [
            {
              "values": ["user-key-123abc"],
              "variation": 0,
              "contextKind": "user"
            }
          ],
          "contextTargets": [
            {
              "values": ["org-key-123abc"],
              "variation": 0,
              "contextKind": "organization"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The `targets` array means that any user context instance with the key `user-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. The `contextTargets` array means that any organization context with the key `org-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this is a boolean flag, both contexts are receiving the `true` variation.

    ### Targeting rules

    The `rules` array corresponds to the rules section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on attributes with conditions and operators. For example, you might create a rule that specifies "roll out the `true` variation to 80% of contexts whose email address ends with `gmail.com`". To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/targeting-rules#creating-targeting-rules).

    ### The fallthrough rule

    The `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual or custom targeting rules match. In the LaunchDarkly UI, it is called the "Default rule."

    ### The off variation

    The off variation represents the variation to serve if the feature flag targeting is turned off, meaning the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.

    ### Percentage rollouts

    When you work with targeting rules and with the default rule, you can specify either a single variation or a percentage rollout. The `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout). The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `60000` means that 60% of contexts will receive that variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.

    > ### This feature is in beta
    >
    > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).
    >
    > Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.

    The account usage API lets you query for metrics about how your account is using LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Account usage metrics](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/billing/usage-metrics).

    Each endpoint returns time-series data in the form of an array of data points with timestamps. Each one contains data for that time from one or more series. It also includes a metadata array describing what each of the series is.
  name: Account usage (beta)
- description: |2

    Contexts are people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts are identified by their `kind`, which describes the type of resources encountering flags, and by their `key`. Each unique combination of one or more contexts that have encountered a feature flag in your product is called a context instance.

    When you use the LaunchDarkly SDK to evaluate a flag, you provide a context to that call. LaunchDarkly records the key and attributes of each context instance. You can view these in the LaunchDarkly user interface from the **Contexts** list, or use the Context APIs. To learn more, read [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).

    LaunchDarkly provides APIs for you to:

    * retrieve contexts, context instances, and context attribute names and values
    * search for contexts or context instances
    * delete context instances
    * fetch context kinds
    * create and update context kinds

    To learn more about context kinds, read [Context kinds](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts/context-kinds).

    Contexts are always scoped within a project and an environment. Each environment has its own set of context instance records.

    Several of the endpoints in the contexts API require a context instance ID or application ID. Both of these IDs are returned as part of the [Search for context instances](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) response. The context instance ID is the `id` field of each element in the `items` array. The application ID is the `applicationId` field of each element in the `items` array. By default, the application ID is set to the SDK you are using. In the LaunchDarkly UI, the application ID and application version appear on the context details page in the "From source" field. You can change the application ID as part of your SDK configuration. To learn more, read [Application metadata configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/app-config).

    ### Filtering contexts and context instances

    When you [search for contexts](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) or [context instances](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), you can filter on certain fields using the `filter` parameter either as a query parameter or as a request body parameter.

    The `filter` parameter supports the following operators: `after`, `anyOf`, `before`, `contains`, `equals`, `exists`, `notEquals`, `startsWith`.

    <details>
    <summary>Expand for details on operators and syntax</summary>

    #### after

    Returns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field, which should be dates, are after the provided time. For example:

    * `myField after "2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00"`

    #### anyOf

    Returns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field match any of the values in the match value. For example:

    * `myField anyOf [44]`
    * `myField anyOf ["phone","tablet"]`
    * `myField anyOf [true]"`

    #### before

    Returns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field, which should be dates, are before the provided time. For example:

    * `myField before "2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00"`

    #### contains

    Returns contexts or context instances if all the match values are found in the list of values in this field. For example:

    * `myListField contains 44`
    * `myListField contains ["phone","tablet"]`
    * `myListField contains true`

    #### equals

    Returns contexts or context instances if there is an exact match on the entire field. For example:

    * `myField equals 44`
    * `myField equals "device"`
    * `myField equals true`
    * `myField equals [1,2,3,4]`
    * `myField equals ["hello","goodbye"]`

    #### exists

    Returns contexts or context instances if the field matches the specified existence. For example:

    * `myField exists true`
    * `myField exists false`
    * `*.name exists true`

    #### notEquals

    Returns contexts or context instances if there is not an exact match on the entire field. For example:

    * `myField notEquals 44`
    * `myField notEquals "device"`
    * `myField notEquals true`
    * `myField notEquals [1,2,3,4]`
    * `myField notEquals ["hello","goodbye"]`

    #### startsWith

    Returns contexts or context instances if the value in a field, which should be a singular string, begins with the provided substring. For example:

    * `myField startsWith "do"`

    </details>

    You can also combine filters in the following ways:

    * Use a comma (`,`) as an AND operator
    * Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator
    * Use parentheses `()` to group filters

    For example:

    * `myField notEquals 0, myField notEquals 1` returns contexts or context instances where `myField` is not 0 and is not 1
    * `myFirstField equals "device",(mySecondField equals "iPhone"|mySecondField equals "iPad")` returns contexts or context instances where `myFirstField` is equal to "device" and `mySecondField` is equal to either "iPhone" or "iPad"

    #### Supported fields and operators

    You can only filter certain fields in contexts and context instances when using the `filter` parameter. Additionally, you can only filter some fields with certain operators.

    When you search for [contexts]((https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)), the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators:

    |<div style="width:120px">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |
    |---|---|---|
    |`applicationId` |An identifier representing the application where the LaunchDarkly SDK is running. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |
    |`id` |Unique identifier for the context. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |
    |`key` |The context key. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |
    |`kind` |The context kind. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |

    >
    > Experimentation is available to customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To add Experimentation to your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).


    > ### This feature is in beta
    >
    > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).
    >
    > Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.

    Experimentation lets you validate the impact of features you roll out to your app or infrastructure. You can measure things like page views, clicks, load time, infrastructure costs, and more. By connecting metrics you create to flags in your LaunchDarkly environment, you can measure the changes in your customers' behavior based on what flags they evaluate. You can run experiments on boolean, string, and number flags, but not JSON flags. To learn more, read [About Experimentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/about-experimentation).

    You can manage experiments by using the dedicated experiment endpoints described below.

    Several of the endpoints require a treatment ID or a flag rule ID. Treatment IDs are returned as part of the [Get experiment results](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getExperimentResults) response. They are the `treatmentId` of each element in the `treatmentResults` array. Winning treatment IDs are also returned as part of the [Get experiment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getExperiment) response. They are the `winningTreatmentId` in the `currentIteration`, the `winningTreatmentId` in the `draftIteration`, and the `winningTreatmentId` in each element of the `previousIterations` array. In the flags object, the rule ID is the ID of the variation or rollout of the flag. Each flag variation ID is returned as part of the [Get feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getFeatureFlag) response. It is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array.

    Customers on older contracts may have experiments created under an older data model. These experiments are listed in the LaunchDarkly user interface as "Legacy experiments." You can manage them by making PATCH requests to the flags API, and you can analyze them by making a GET request to the deprecated [Get legacy experiment results](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getLegacyExperimentResults) endpoint. To learn more about legacy experiments, read [Legacy experiments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/managing-experiments#legacy-experiments).

    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand details on using the PATCH requests to the flags API to manage legacy experiments</summary>

    ### Managing legacy experiments

    To manage legacy experiments, make the following PATCH requests to the flags API:

    #### Adding an experiment

    To add an experiment to a flag, add a new object to the `/experiments/items/` property.

    The object must contain:

    1. The key of the metric you want to use for the experiment.
    2. (Optional) A list of keys for the environments where the experiment should record data.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
        {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/experiments/items/0",
            "value": {
                "metricKey": "metric-key-123abc",
                "environments": []
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

    #### Removing an experiment

    To remove an experiment, remove the corresponding item from the experiments or items property.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
        {
            "op": "remove",
            "path": "/experiments/items/0"
        }
    ]
    ```

    #### Starting or resuming an experiment

    To start recording data for an experiment in an environment, add the environment key to the list of environments for that experiment.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
        {
            "op": "add",
            "path": "/experiments/items/0/environments/0",
            "value": "production"
        }
    ]
    ```

    #### Stopping an experiment

    To stop collecting data for an experiment in a specific environment, remove the environment from the list that experiment uses.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
      {
        "op": "remove",
        "path": "/experiments/items/0/environments/0"
      }
    ]
    ```

    #### Updating the baseline

    To update the baseline for all experiments on a flag across all environments in the project, replace the `baselineIdx` property with the index of the new baseline variation.

    ```json
    PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}
    [
      {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/experiments/baselineIdx",
        "value": 1
      }
    ]
    ```

    > ### Teams is an Enterprise feature
    >
    > Teams is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

    A team is a group of members in your LaunchDarkly account. A team can have maintainers who are able to add and remove team members. It also can have custom roles assigned to it that allows shared access to those roles for all team members. To learn more, read [Teams](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams).

    The Teams API allows you to create, read, update, and delete a team.

    Several of the endpoints in the Teams API require one or more member IDs. The member ID is returned as part of the [List account members](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) response. It is the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.
  name: Teams

    > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).
    >
    > Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.

    The applications API lets you create, update, delete, and search for applications and application versions.

    Each application includes information about the app you're creating, and a set of versions of the app that you've released. You can use applications to target particular application versions in your feature flags more easily, and to handle unsupported application versions more gracefully.

    In addition to creating applications through the applications API, you can also create applications in the LaunchDarkly user interface. To learn more, read [Applications](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/applications). LaunchDarkly also creates applications and application versions automatically when a LaunchDarkly SDK evaluates a feature flag for a context that includes application information. To learn more, read [Automatic environment attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/environment-attributes).

    You can use an application in any project in your LaunchDarkly account.

    ### Filtering applications and application versions

    The `filter` parameter supports the following operators: `equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith`.

    You can also combine filters in the following ways:

    - Use a comma (`,`) as an AND operator
    - Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator
    - Use parentheses (`()`) to group filters

    #### Supported fields and operators

    You can only filter certain fields in applications when using the `filter` parameter. Additionally, you can only filter some fields with certain operators.

    When you search for applications, the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators:

    |<div style="width:120px">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |
    |---|---|---|
    |`key` | The application or application version key, a unique identifier |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |
    |`name` | The application name or application version name |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |
    |`autoAdded` | Whether the application or application version was automatically created because it was included in a context when a LaunchDarkly SDK evaluated a feature flag, or was created through the LaunchDarkly UI or REST API |`equals`, `notEquals` |
    |`kind` | The application kind, one of `mobile`, `server`, `browser`. Only available for [Get applications](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getApplications). |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |
    |`supported` | Whether a mobile application version is supported or unsupported. Only available for [Get application versions by application key](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getApplicationVersions).|`equals`, `notEquals` |

    For example, the filter `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile', 'server']` matches applications whose `kind` is either `mobile` or `server`. The filter is not case-sensitive.

    The documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `[` in `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile', 'server']` must be encoded to `%5B`.

    ### Sorting applications and application versions

    LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:
    - `name` sorts by application name.
    - `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the application.

    By default, the sort is in ascending order. Use `-` to sort in descending order. For example, `?sort=name` sorts the response by application name in ascending order, and `?sort=-name` sorts in descending order.

    You can use the integrations API to create, delete, and manage integrations between LaunchDarkly and third-party applications.

    Specifically, the integrations API provides endpoints for managing the persistent store integrations, also called "big segment" store integrations, that are required when you use a server-side SDK and big segments.

    > ### Synced segments and larger list-based segments are an Enterprise feature
    >
    > Segments synced from external tools and larger list-based segments with more than 15,000 entries are the two kinds of "big segment." LaunchDarkly uses different implementations for different types of segments so that all of your segments have good performance.
    >
    > These segments are available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

    [Segments synced from external tools](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/synced-segments) and [larger list-based segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/list-based-segments#larger-list-based-segments) are the two kinds of big segment. If you are using server-side SDKs, these segments require a persistent store within your infrastructure. LaunchDarkly keeps the persistent store up to date and consults it during flag evaluation.

    You need either a persistent store integration or a [Relay Proxy](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/relay-proxy) to support these segments. The integrations API lets you manage the persistent store integrations.

    To learn more about segments, read [Segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments) and [Segment configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/big-segment-configuration).

    Several of the endpoints in the integrations API require an integration ID. The integration ID is returned as part of the [Create big segment store integration](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createBigSegmentStoreIntegration) response, in the `_id` field. It is also returned as part of the [List all big segment store integrations](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getBigSegmentStoreIntegrations) response, in the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.

    You can find other APIs for working with big segments under [Segments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Segments (beta)](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)).

    > Metrics is available to customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To add metrics to your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

    Metrics track flag behavior over time when an experiment is running. The data generated from experiments gives you more insight into the impact of a particular flag. To learn more, read [Metrics](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/metrics).

    Using the metrics API, you can create, delete, and manage metrics.

    > ### Are you importing metric events?
    >
    > If you want to import metric events into LaunchDarkly from an existing data source, use the metric import API. To learn more, read [Importing metric events](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

    > ### Metric keys and event keys are different
    >
    > LaunchDarkly automatically generates a metric key when you create a metric. You can use the metric key to identify the metric in API calls.
    >
    > Custom conversion/binary and custom numeric metrics also require an event key. You can set the event key to anything you want. Adding this event key to your codebase lets your SDK track actions customers take in your app as events.

    The OAuth2 client API allows you to register a LaunchDarkly OAuth client for use in your own custom integrations. Registering a LaunchDarkly OAuth client allows you to use LaunchDarkly as an identity provider so that account members can log into your application with their LaunchDarkly account.

    You can create and manage LaunchDarkly OAuth clients using the LaunchDarkly OAuth client API. This API acknowledges creation of your client with a response containing a one-time, unique `_clientSecret`. If you lose your client secret, you will have to register a new client. LaunchDarkly does not store client secrets in plain text.

    Several of the endpoints in the OAuth2 client API require an OAuth client ID. The OAuth client ID is returned as part of the [Create a LaunchDarkly OAuth 2.0 client](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Get clients](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_clientId` field, or the `_clientId` field of each element in the `items` array.

    You must have _Admin_ privileges or an access token created by a member with _Admin_ privileges in order to be able to use this feature.

    Please note that `redirectUri`s must be absolute URIs that conform to the https URI scheme. If you wish to register a client with a different URI scheme, please contact LaunchDarkly Support.

    Release pipelines track the progression of a feature flag across a series of phases, where each phase consists of one or more environments. When you add a flag to a release pipeline, you create a "release" to track that flag's progress through the pipeline.

    You can use release pipelines to ensure that you correctly roll out the flag in each environment before moving on to the next. You can also use them to view the status of ongoing releases across all flags within a project, enforcing a standardized process and ensuring they are following best practices. To learn more, read [Release pipelines](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/release-pipelines).

    With the release pipelines API, you can view, create, and delete release pipelines.

    With the related [releases API](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)), you can view and update the active releases for a given flag.

    To add a feature flag to an existing release pipeline, use the [Update feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint.

    Schedule the specified flag targeting changes to take effect at the selected time. You may schedule multiple changes for a flag each with a different `ExecutionDate`. To learn more, read [Scheduled flag changes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/scheduled-changes).

    Several of the endpoints in the scheduled changes API require a scheduled change ID. The scheduled change ID is returned as part of the [Create scheduled changes workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [List scheduled changes](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.

    > After you have upgraded your LaunchDarkly SDK to use contexts instead of users, you should use [Contexts](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) instead of the user settings API. To learn more, read [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).

    LaunchDarkly's user settings API provides a picture of all feature flags and their current values for a specific user. This gives you instant visibility into how a particular user experiences your site or application. To learn more, read [Viewing and managing users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users/attributes#viewing-and-managing-users).

    You can also use the user settings API to assign a user to a specific variation for any feature flag.

- description: |
    The webhooks API lets you build your own integrations that subscribe to activities in LaunchDarkly. When you generate an activity in LaunchDarkly, such as when you change a flag or you create a project, LaunchDarkly sends an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's URL. Use webhooks to update external issue trackers, update support tickets, notify customers of new feature rollouts, and more.

    Several of the endpoints in the webhooks API require a webhook ID. The webhook ID is returned as part of the [Creates a webhook](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [List webhooks](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.

    ## Designating the payload

    The webhook payload is identical to an audit log entry. To learn more, read [Get audit log entry](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

    Here's a sample payload:

    > ### Webhook delivery order
    >
    > Webhooks may not be delivered in chronological order. We recommend using the payload's "date" field as a timestamp to reorder webhooks as they are received.

    ```json
    {
      "_links": {
        "canonical": {
          "href": "/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test",
          "type": "application/json"
        },
        "parent": {
          "href": "/api/v2/auditlog",
          "type": "application/json"
        },
        "self": {
          "href": "/api/v2/auditlog/57c0a8e29969090743529965",
          "type": "application/json"
        },
        "site": {
          "href": "/settings#/projects",

        }
      ],
      "kind": "environment",
      "name": "Testing",
      "description": "- Changed the name from ~~Test~~ to *Testing*",
      "member": {
        "_links": {
          "parent": {
            "href": "/internal/account/members",
            "type": "application/json"
          },
          "self": {
            "href": "/internal/account/members/548f6741c1efad40031b18ae",
            "type": "application/json"
          }
        },
        "_id": "548f6741c1efad40031b18ae",
        "email": "ariel@acme.com",
        "firstName": "Ariel",
        "lastName": "Flores"
      },
      "titleVerb": "changed the name of",
      "title": "[Ariel Flores](mailto:ariel@acme.com) changed the name of [Testing](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)",
      "target": {
        "_links": {
          "canonical": {
            "href": "/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test",
            "type": "application/json"
          },
          "site": {
            "href": "/settings#/projects",
            "type": "text/html"
          }
        },
        "name": "Testing",
        "resources": ["proj/alexis:env/test"]
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Signing the webhook

    Optionally, you can define a `secret` when you create a webhook. If you define the secret, the webhook `POST` request will include an `X-LD-Signature header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex digest of the webhook payload, using the `secret` as the key.

    Compute the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your code to verify that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.

    ## Understanding connection retries

    If LaunchDarkly receives a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`, it will retry the delivery one time. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If you build an integration on webhooks, make sure it is tolerant of delivery failures.

    Flag links let you view external mentions of flags from other tools and services. Links to external conversations and references to your flags allow you to collaborate more easily and quickly review relevant flag contexts. To learn more, read [Flag links](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/links).

    You can create custom flag links by associating an external URL with a feature flag. After you create a flag link, it applies across all your environments. You should use caution when you delete a flag link, because it will be deleted from all your environments.

    With the flag links API, you can view, create, update, and delete links to flags.

    Several of the endpoints in the flag links API require a flag link ID. The flag link ID is returned as part of the [Create flag link](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createFlagLink) and [List flag links](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getFlagLinks) responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.

    The segments API allows you to create and retrieve exports and imports for big segments, which are synced segments or list-based segments with 15,000 or more entries. To learn more, read [Segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments).

    Several of the endpoints in the segments API require an import or export ID. The import ID is returned in the `Location` header as part of the [Create big segment import](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createBigSegmentImport) request. The export ID is returned in the `Location` header as part of the [Create big segment export](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createBigSegmentExport) request. In each case, the ID is the final element of the path returned in the `Location` header.

    You can find other APIs for working with big segments under [Segments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Integrations (beta)](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)).

    LaunchDarkly creates a record for each user passed in to `variation` calls. This record powers the autocomplete functionality on the feature flag dashboard, as well as the Users page. To learn more, read [Users and user segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users).

    LaunchDarkly also offers an API that lets you tap into this data. You can use the users API to see what user data is available to LaunchDarkly, as well as determine which flag values a user will receive. You can also explicitly set which flag value a user will receive via this API.

    Users are always scoped within a project and environment. In other words, each environment has its own set of user records.

    > ### Workflows is an Enterprise feature
    >
    > Workflows is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

    A workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make changes to a feature flag at a future date and time. You can also include approval requests at different stages of a workflow. To learn more, read [Workflows](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows).

    The actions supported are as follows:

    - Turning targeting `ON` or `OFF`
    - Setting the default variation
    - Adding targets to a given variation
    - Creating a rule to target by segment
    - Modifying the rollout percentage for rules

    You can create multiple stages of a flag release workflow. Unique stages are defined by their conditions: either approvals and/or scheduled changes.

    Several of the endpoints in the workflows API require a workflow ID or one or more member IDs. The workflow ID is returned as part of the [Create workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Get workflows](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array. The member ID is returned as part of the [List account members](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) response.

    >
    > Workflow templates are available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

    Workflow templates allow you to define a set of workflow stages that you can use as a starting point for new workflows. You can create these workflows for any flag in any environment and any project, and you can create as many workflows as you like from a given template.

    You can create workflow templates in two ways:
    * by specifying the desired stages, using the `stages` property of the request body
    * by specifying an existing workflow to save as a template, using the `workflowId` property of the request body

    You can use templates to create a workflow in any project, environment, or flag. However, when you create a template, you must specify a particular project, environment, and flag. This means that when you create a template using the `stages` property, you must also include `projectKey`, `environmentKey`, and `flagKey` properties in the request body. When you create a template from an existing workflow, it will use the project, environment, and flag of the existing workflow, so those properties can be omitted from the request body.

    To learn more, read [Workflows documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows) and [Workflows API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Workflows).

    > After you have upgraded your LaunchDarkly SDK to use contexts instead of users, you should use [Contexts](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) instead of these endpoints. To learn more, read [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).

    LaunchDarkly creates a record for each user passed in to `variation` calls. This record powers the autocomplete functionality on the feature flag dashboard, as well as the Users page. To learn more, read [Users and user segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users)

    LaunchDarkly also offers an API that lets you access this data. You can use the users API to see what user data is available to LaunchDarkly, as well as determine which flag values a user will receive. You can also explicitly set which flag value a user will receive with this API.

    Users are always scoped within both a project and an environment. Each environment has its own set of user records.

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the "Get applications" response to include additional fields.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include the following:

        * `flags` includes details on the flags that have been evaluated by the application

        For example, use `?expand=flags` to include the `flags` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        ### Filtering approvals

        LaunchDarkly supports the `filter` query param for filtering, with the following fields:

        - `notifyMemberIds` filters for only approvals that are assigned to a member in the specified list. For example: `filter=notifyMemberIds anyOf ["memberId1", "memberId2"]`.
        - `requestorId` filters for only approvals that correspond to the ID of the member who requested the approval. For example: `filter=requestorId equals 457034721476302714390214`.
        - `resourceId` filters for only approvals that correspond to the the specified resource identifier. For example: `filter=resourceId equals proj/my-project:env/my-environment:flag/my-flag`.
        - `reviewStatus` filters for only approvals which correspond to the review status in the specified list. The possible values are `approved`, `declined`, and `pending`. For example: `filter=reviewStatus anyOf ["pending", "approved"]`.
        - `status` filters for only approvals which correspond to the status in the specified list. The possible values are `pending`, `scheduled`, `failed`, and `completed`. For example: `filter=status anyOf ["pending", "scheduled"]`.

        You can also apply multiple filters at once. For example, setting `filter=projectKey equals my-project, reviewStatus anyOf ["pending","approved"]` matches approval requests which correspond to the `my-project` project key, and a review status of either `pending` or `approved`.

        ### Expanding approval response

        LaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional fields in the response, with the following fields:

        - `flag` includes the flag the approval request belongs to
        - `project` includes the project the approval request belongs to
        - `environments` includes the environments the approval request relates to

        For example, `expand=project,flag` includes the `project` and `flag` fields in the response.

      description: |
        Get a list of all feature flags in the given project. By default, each flag includes configurations for each environment. You can filter environments with the `env` query parameter. For example, setting `env=production` restricts the returned configurations to just your production environment. You can also filter feature flags by tag with the `tag` query parameter.

        > #### Recommended use
        >
        > This endpoint can return a large amount of information. We recommend using some or all of these query parameters to decrease response time and overall payload size: `limit`, `env`, `query`, and `filter=creationDate`.

        ### Filtering flags

        You can filter on certain fields using the `filter` query parameter. For example, setting `filter=query:dark-mode,tags:beta+test` matches flags with the string `dark-mode` in their key or name, ignoring case, which also have the tags `beta` and `test`.

        The `filter` query parameter supports the following arguments:

        | Filter argument       | Description | Example              |
        |-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
        | `archived`              | A boolean value. It filters the list to archived flags. Setting the value to `true` returns only archived flags. When this is absent, only unarchived flags are returned. | `filter=archived:true` |
        | `contextKindsEvaluated` | A `+`-separated list of context kind keys. It filters the list to flags which have been evaluated in the past 30 days for all of the context kinds in the list. | `filter=contextKindsEvaluated:user+application` |
        | `contextKindTargeted`   | A string. It filters the list to flags that are targeting the given context kind key. | `filter=contextKindTargeted:user` |
        | `codeReferences.max`    | An integer value. Use `0` to return flags that do not have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.max:0` |
        | `codeReferences.min`    | An integer value. Use `1` to return flags that do have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.min:1` |
        | `creationDate`          | An object with an optional `before` field whose value is Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to flags created before the date. | `filter=creationDate:{"before":1690527600000}` |
        | `evaluated`             | An object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to all flags that have been evaluated since the time you specify, in the environment provided. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. | `filter=evaluation:{"after":1690527600000}` |
        | `filterEnv`             | A string with the key of a valid environment. You must use this field for filters that are environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific filters, you only need to include this field once. | `filter=evaluated:{"after": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active` |
        | `followerId`            | A valid member ID. It filters the list to flags that are being followed by this member. |  `filter=followerId:12ab3c45de678910abc12345` |
        | `hasDataExport`         | A boolean value. It filters the list to flags that are exporting data in the specified environment. This includes flags that are exporting data from Experimentation. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. | `filter=hasDataExport:true,filterEnv:production` |
        | `hasExperiment`         | A boolean value. It filters the list to flags that are used in an experiment. | `filter=hasExperiment:true` |
        | `maintainerId`          | A valid member ID. It filters the list to flags that are maintained by this member. | `filter=maintainerId:12ab3c45de678910abc12345` |
        | `maintainerTeamKey`     | A string. It filters the list to flags that are maintained by the team with this key. | `filter=maintainerTeamKey:example-team-key` |
        | `query`                 | A string. It filters the list to flags that include the specified string in their key or name. It is not case sensitive. | `filter=query:example` |
        | `sdkAvailability`       | A string, one of `client`, `mobile`, `anyClient`, `server`. Using `client` filters the list to flags whose client-side SDK availability is set to use the client-side ID. Using `mobile` filters to flags set to use the mobile key. Using `anyClient` filters to flags set to use either the client-side ID or the mobile key. Using `server` filters to flags set to use neither, that is, to flags only available in server-side SDKs.  | `filter=sdkAvailability:client` |
        | `segmentTargeted`       | A string. It filters the list to flags that target the segment with this key. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. | `filter=segmentTargeted:example-segment-key,filterEnv:production` |
        | `status`                | A string, either `new`, `inactive`, `active`, or `launched`. It filters the list to flags with the specified status in the specified environment. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. | `filter=status:active,filterEnv:production` |
        | `tags`                  | A `+`-separated list of tags. It filters the list to flags that have all of the tags in the list. | `filter=tags:beta+test` |
        | `type`                  | A string, either `temporary` or `permanent`. It filters the list to flags with the specified type. | `filter=type:permanent` |

        The documented values for the `filter` query are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:beta+test` must be encoded to `%2B`.

        By default, this endpoint returns all flags. You can page through the list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.

        ### Sorting flags

        You can sort flags based on the following fields:

        - `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the flag.
        - `key` sorts by the key of the flag.
        - `maintainerId` sorts by the flag maintainer.
        - `name` sorts by flag name.
        - `tags` sorts by tags.
        - `targetingModifiedDate` sorts by the date that the flag's targeting rules were last modified in a given environment. It must be used with `env` parameter and it can not be combined with any other sort. If multiple `env` values are provided, it will perform sort using the first one. For example, `sort=-targetingModifiedDate&env=production&env=staging` returns results sorted by `targetingModifiedDate` for the `production` environment.
        - `type` sorts by flag type

        All fields are sorted in ascending order by default. To sort in descending order, prefix the field with a dash ( - ). For example, `sort=-name` sorts the response by flag name in descending order.

        ### Expanding response

        LaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional fields in the response, with the following fields:

        - `codeReferences` includes code references for the feature flag
        - `evaluation` includes evaluation information within returned environments, including which context kinds the flag has been evaluated for in the past 30 days
        - `migrationSettings` includes migration settings information within the flag and within returned environments. These settings are only included for migration flags, that is, where `purpose` is `migration`.

        For example, `expand=evaluation` includes the `evaluation` field in the response.

        ### Migration flags
        For migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules` property of a flag's response, and default cohort information is included in the `fallthrough` property of a flag's response.
        To learn more, read [Migration Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).

        Create a feature flag with the given name, key, and variations.

        ### Creating a migration flag

        When you create a migration flag, the variations are pre-determined based on the number of stages in the migration.
        To create a migration flag, omit the `variations` and `defaults` information. Instead, provide a `purpose` of `migration`, and `migrationSettings`. If you create a migration flag with six stages, `contextKind` is required. Otherwise, it should be omitted.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "key": "flag-key-123",
          "purpose": "migration",
          "migrationSettings": {
            "stageCount": 6,
            "contextKind": "account"
          }
        }
        ```

        \ (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the\
        \ list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction.\
        \ If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as\
        \ additional fields in the object. The body of a single semantic patch can\
        \ contain many different instructions.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch\

        \ flags.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>turning\
        \ flags on and off</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey`\
        \ parameter.\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **Off**.\n\
        \nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\"\
        ,\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\
        \nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>working with targeting and\
        \ variations</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey`\
        \ parameter.\n\nSeveral of the instructions for working with targeting and\
        \ variations require flag rule IDs, variation IDs, or clause IDs as parameters.\
        \ Each of these are returned as part of the [Get feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)\
        \ response. The flag rule ID is the `_id` field of each element in the `rules`\
        \ array within each environment listed in the `environments` object. The variation\
        \ ID is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array. The clause\
        \ ID is the `_id` field of each element of the `clauses` array within the\
        \ `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object.\n\
        \n#### addClauses\n\nAdds the given clauses to the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\
        \n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauses`:\
        \ Array of clause objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string),\
        \ `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers,\
        \ or dates) properties. The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case\
        \ sensitive. The `op` must be lower-case.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n\
        {\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\":\
        \ [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addClauses\",\n\t\t\"ruleId\": \"a902ef4a-2faf-4eaf-88e1-ecc356708a29\"\

        \n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addRule\n\nAdds a new targeting rule to the flag. The\
        \ rule may contain `clauses` and serve the variation that `variationId` indicates,\
        \ or serve a percentage rollout that `rolloutWeights`, `rolloutBucketBy`,\
        \ and `rolloutContextKind` indicate.\n\nIf you set `beforeRuleId`, this adds\
        \ the new rule before the indicated rule. Otherwise, adds the new rule to\
        \ the end of the list.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `clauses`: Array of clause\
        \ objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string), `op` (string),\

        \ on a feature flag\n\nIf you do not include the semantic patch header described\
        \ above, you can use a [JSON patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) or [JSON\
        \ merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation\
        \ of the desired changes.\n\nIn the JSON patch representation, use a JSON\
        \ pointer in the `path` element to describe what field to change. Use the\
        \ [Get feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint to find the\
        \ field you want to update.\n\nThere are a few special cases to keep in mind\
        \ when determining the value of the `path` element:\n\n  * To add an individual\
        \ target to a specific variation if the flag variation already has individual\
        \ targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n \
        \   {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-\"\
        ,\n      \"value\": \"TestClient10\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add an individual\
        \ target to a specific variation if the flag variation does not already have\
        \ individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n\
        \  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/-\"\
        ,\n      \"value\": { \"variation\": 0, \"values\": [\"TestClient10\"] }\n\
        \    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add a flag to a release pipeline, the path for\
        \ the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"\
        add\",\n      \"path\": \"/releasePipelineKey\",\n      \"value\": \"example-release-pipeline-key\"\
        \n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Required approvals\nIf a request attempts to alter\
        \ a flag configuration in an environment where approvals are required for\
        \ the flag, the request will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration\
        \ in that environment will require creating an [approval request](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)\
        \ or a [workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).\n\n### Conflicts\nIf\
        \ a flag configuration change made through this endpoint would cause a pending\
        \ scheduled change or approval request to fail, this endpoint will return\
        \ a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts` query parameter\
        \ set to `true`.\n\n### Migration flags\nFor migration flags, the cohort information\
        \ is included in the `rules` property of a flag's response. You can update\
        \ cohorts by updating `rules`. Default cohort information is included in the\
        \ `fallthrough` property of a flag's response. You can update the default\
        \ cohort by updating `fallthrough`.\nWhen you update the rollout for a cohort\
        \ or the default cohort through the API, provide a rollout instead of a single\
        \ `variationId`.\nTo learn more, read [Migration Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).\n"

        Copy flag settings from a source environment to a target environment.

        By default, this operation copies the entire flag configuration. You can use the `includedActions` or `excludedActions` to specify that only part of the flag configuration is copied.

        If you provide the optional `currentVersion` of a flag, this operation tests to ensure that the current flag version in the environment matches the version you've specified. The operation rejects attempts to copy flag settings if the environment's current version  of the flag does not match the version you've specified. You can use this to enforce optimistic locking on copy attempts.

    patch:
      description: |
        Schedule a context for removal from individual targeting on a feature flag. The flag must already individually target the context.

        You can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule a context for removal on a single variation per flag.

        Updating an expiring target uses the semantic patch format. To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating expiring targets.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring targets</strong></summary>

        #### addExpiringTarget

        Adds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the context from the flag's individual targeting.

        ##### Parameters

        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the context from individual targeting for this flag
        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `contextKey`: The context key for the context to remove from individual targeting
        * `contextKind`: The kind of context represented by the `contextKey`

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExpiringTarget",
            "value": 1754006460000,
            "variationId": "4254742c-71ae-411f-a992-43b18a51afe0",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user"
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### updateExpiringTarget

        Updates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the context from the flag's individual targeting

        ##### Parameters

        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the context from individual targeting for this flag
        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `contextKey`: The context key for the context to remove from individual targeting
        * `contextKind`: The kind of context represented by the `contextKey`
        * `version`: (Optional) The version of the expiring target to update. If included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of the expiring target.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateExpiringTarget",
            "value": 1754006460000,
            "variationId": "4254742c-71ae-411f-a992-43b18a51afe0",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user"
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### removeExpiringTarget

        Removes the scheduled removal of the context from the flag's individual targeting. The context will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until you explicitly remove it, or until you schedule another removal.

        ##### Parameters

        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `contextKey`: The context key for the context to remove from individual targeting
        * `contextKind`: The kind of context represented by the `contextKey`

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExpiringTarget",
            "variationId": "4254742c-71ae-411f-a992-43b18a51afe0",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user"
          }]
        }

        > After you have upgraded your LaunchDarkly SDK to use contexts instead of users, you should use [Update expiring context targets on feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) instead of this endpoint. To learn more, read [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).

        Schedule a target for removal from individual targeting on a feature flag. The flag must already serve a variation to specific targets based on their key.

        You can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule a target for removal on a single variation per flag.

        Updating an expiring target uses the semantic patch format. To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating expiring user targets.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring user targets</strong></summary>

        #### addExpireUserTargetDate

        Adds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.

        ##### Parameters

        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag
        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting

        #### updateExpireUserTargetDate

        Updates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.

        ##### Parameters

        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag
        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting
        * `version`: (Optional) The version of the expiring user target to update. If included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of the expiring user target.

        #### removeExpireUserTargetDate

        Removes the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual targeting. The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until you explicitly remove them, or until you schedule another removal.

        ##### Parameters

        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting

    patch:
      description: |
        Update a flag trigger. Updating a flag trigger uses the semantic patch format.

        To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating flag triggers.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating flag triggers</strong></summary>

        #### replaceTriggerActionInstructions

        Removes the existing trigger action and replaces it with the new instructions.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: An array of the new `kind`s of actions to perform when triggering. Supported flag actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.

        Here's an example that replaces the existing action with new instructions to turn flag targeting off:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [
            {
              "kind": "replaceTriggerActionInstructions",
              "value": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOff"} ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### cycleTriggerUrl

        Generates a new URL for this trigger. You must update any clients using the trigger to use this new URL.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "cycleTriggerUrl" }]
        }
        ```

        #### disableTrigger

        Disables the trigger. This saves the trigger configuration, but the trigger stops running. To re-enable, use `enableTrigger`.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "disableTrigger" }]
        }
        ```

        #### enableTrigger

        Enables the trigger. If you previously disabled the trigger, it begins running again.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "enableTrigger" }]
        }
        ```

        Create a persistent store integration.

        If you are using server-side SDKs, segments synced from external tools and larger list-based segments require a persistent store within your infrastructure. LaunchDarkly keeps the persistent store up to date and consults it during flag evaluation.

        You can use either Redis or DynamoDB as your persistent store. When you create a persistent store integration, the fields in the `config` object in the request vary depending on which persistent store you use.

        If you are using Redis to create your persistent store integration, you will need to know:

        * Your Redis host
        * Your Redis port
        * Your Redis username
        * Your Redis password
        * Whether or not LaunchDarkly should connect using TLS

        If you are using DynamoDB to create your persistent store integration, you will need to know:

        * Your DynamoDB table name. The table must have the following schema:
          * Partition key: `namespace` (string)
          * Sort key: `key` (string)
        * Your DynamoDB Amazon Web Services (AWS) region.
        * Your AWS role Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This is the role that LaunchDarkly will assume to manage your DynamoDB table.
        * The External ID you specified when creating your Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

        To learn more, read [Segment configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/big-segment-configuration).

  /api/v2/members:
    get:
      description: |
        Return a list of account members.

        By default, this returns the first 20 members. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.

        ### Filtering members

        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:

        - `query` is a string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.
        - `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.
        - `team` is a string that matches against the key of the teams the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.
        - `noteam` is a boolean that filters the list of members who are not on a team if true and members on a team if false.
        - `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following formats:
          - `{"never": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.
          - `{"noData": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.
          - `{"before": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.
        - `accessCheck` is a string that represents a specific action on a specific resource and is in the format `<ActionSpecifier>:<ResourceSpecifier>`. It filters the list to members who have the ability to perform that action on that resource. Note: `accessCheck` is only supported in API version `20220603` and earlier. To learn more, read [Versioning](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/#section/Overview/Versioning).
          - For example, the filter `accessCheck:createApprovalRequest:proj/default:env/test:flag/alternate-page` matches members with the ability to create an approval request for the `alternate-page` flag in the `test` environment of the `default` project.
          - Wildcard and tag filters are not supported when filtering for access.

        For example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.

        ### Sorting members

        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:

        - `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if no name is set.
        - `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.

        > ### Full use of this API resource is an Enterprise feature
        >
        > The ability to perform a partial update to multiple members is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. If you are on a Pro plan, you can update members individually. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

        Perform a partial update to multiple members. Updating members uses the semantic patch format.

        To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating members.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating members</strong></summary>

        #### replaceMembersRoles

        Replaces the roles of the specified members. This also removes all custom roles assigned to the specified members.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: The new role. Must be a valid built-in role. To learn more about built-in roles, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/members/built-in-roles).
        - `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "replaceMemberRoles",
            "value": "reader",
            "memberIDs": [
              "1234a56b7c89d012345e678f",
              "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"
            ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### replaceAllMembersRoles

        Replaces the roles of all members. This also removes all custom roles assigned to the specified members.

        Members that match any of the filters are **excluded** from the update.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: The new role. Must be a valid built-in role. To learn more about built-in roles, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/members/built-in-roles).
        - `filterLastSeen`: (Optional) A JSON object with one of the following formats:
          - `{"never": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.
          - `{"noData": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.
          - `{"before": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.
        - `filterQuery`: (Optional) A string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.
        - `filterRoles`: (Optional) A `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.
        - `filterTeamKey`: (Optional) A string that matches against the key of the team the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.
        - `ignoredMemberIDs`: (Optional) A list of member IDs.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "replaceAllMembersRoles",
            "value": "reader",
            "filterLastSeen": { "never": true }

        Invite one or more new members to join an account. Each member is sent an invitation. Members with "admin" or "owner" roles may create new members, as well as anyone with a "createMember" permission for "member/\*". If a member cannot be invited, the entire request is rejected and no members are invited from that request.

        Each member _must_ have an `email` field and either a `role` or a `customRoles` field. If any of the fields are not populated correctly, the request is rejected with the reason specified in the "message" field of the response.

        Requests to create account members will not work if SCIM is enabled for the account.

        _No more than 50 members may be created per request._

        A request may also fail because of conflicts with existing members. These conflicts are reported using the additional `code` and `invalid_emails` response fields with the following possible values for `code`:

        - **email_already_exists_in_account**: A member with this email address already exists in this account.
        - **email_taken_in_different_account**: A member with this email address exists in another account.
        - **duplicate_email**s: This request contains two or more members with the same email address.

        A request that fails for one of the above reasons returns an HTTP response code of 400 (Bad Request).

        Update a single account member. Updating a member uses a [JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) representation of the desired changes. To learn more, read [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        To update fields in the account member object that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Use `/0` to add to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add to the end of the array. For example, to add a new custom role to a member, use the following request body:

        ```
          [
            {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/customRoles/0",
              "value": "some-role-id"
            }
          ]
        ```

        You can update only an account member's role or custom role using a JSON patch. Members can update their own names and email addresses though the LaunchDarkly UI.

        When SAML SSO or SCIM is enabled for the account, account members are managed in the Identity Provider (IdP). Requests to update account members will succeed, but the IdP will override the update shortly afterwards.

        ### Expanding the metric list response
        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the "List metrics" response. By default, the expandable field is **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add the following supported field:

        - `experimentCount` includes the number of experiments from the specific project that use the metric

        For example, `expand=experimentCount` includes the `experimentCount` field for each metric in the response.

        ### Expanding the metric response
        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get metric" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

        - `experiments` includes all experiments from the specific project that use the metric
        - `experimentCount` includes the number of experiments from the specific project that use the metric
        - `metricGroups` includes all metric groups from the specific project that use the metric
        - `metricGroupCount` includes the number of metric groups from the specific project that use the metric

        For example, `expand=experiments` includes the `experiments` field in the response.

        Return a list of projects.

        By default, this returns the first 20 projects. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.

        ### Filtering projects

        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:
        - `query` is a string that matches against the projects' names and keys. It is not case sensitive.
        - `tags` is a `+`-separated list of project tags. It filters the list of projects that have all of the tags in the list.

        For example, the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches projects with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.

        The documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be encoded to `%2B`.

        ### Sorting projects

        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting:
        - `name` sorts by project name.
        - `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the project.

        For example, `sort=name` sorts the response by project name in ascending order.

        ### Expanding the projects response

        LaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the "List projects" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with the `environments` field.

        `Environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.
        * `environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.

        For example, `expand=environments` includes the `environments` field for each project in the response.

        ### Expanding the project response

        LaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the "Get project" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:
        * `environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.

        For example, `expand=environments` includes the `environments` field for the project in the response.

  /api/v2/projects/{projectKey}/environments:
    get:
      description: |
        Return a list of environments for the specified project.

        By default, this returns the first 20 environments. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.

        ### Filtering environments

        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:
        - `query` is a string that matches against the environments' names and keys. It is not case sensitive.
        - `tags` is a `+`-separated list of environment tags. It filters the list of environments that have all of the tags in the list.

        For example, the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches environments with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.

        The documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be encoded to `%2B`.

        ### Sorting environments

        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:

        - `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the environment.
        - `critical` sorts by whether the environments are marked as critical.
        - `name` sorts by environment name.

        For example, `sort=name` sorts the response by environment name in ascending order.

        Update an environment. Updating an environment uses a [JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) representation of the desired changes. To learn more, read [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        To update fields in the environment object that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using `/0` appends to the beginning of the array.

        ### Approval settings

        This request only returns the `approvalSettings` key if the [Flag Approvals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/approvals) feature is enabled.

        Only the `canReviewOwnRequest`, `canApplyDeclinedChanges`, `minNumApprovals`, `required` and `requiredApprovalTagsfields` are editable.

        If you try to patch the environment by setting both `required` and `requiredApprovalTags`, the request fails and an error appears. You can specify either required approvals for all flags in an environment or those with specific tags, but not both.

        Enable or disable a feature flag for a context based on its context kind and key.

        Omitting the `setting` attribute from the request body, or including a `setting` of `null`, erases the current setting for a context.

        If you previously patched the flag, and the patch included the context's data, LaunchDarkly continues to use that data. If LaunchDarkly has never encountered the combination of the context's key and kind before, it calculates the flag values based on the context kind and key.

        ### Filtering experiments

        LaunchDarkly supports the `filter` query param for filtering, with the following fields:

        - `flagKey` filters for only experiments that use the flag with the given key.
        - `metricKey` filters for only experiments that use the metric with the given key.
        - `status` filters for only experiments with an iteration with the given status. An iteration can have the status `not_started`, `running` or `stopped`.

        For example, `filter=flagKey:my-flag,status:running,metricKey:page-load-ms` filters for experiments for the given flag key and the given metric key which have a currently running iteration.

        ### Expanding the experiments response

        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get experiments" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

        - `previousIterations` includes all iterations prior to the current iteration. By default only the current iteration is included in the response.
        - `draftIteration` includes the iteration which has not been started yet, if any.
        - `secondaryMetrics` includes secondary metrics. By default only the primary metric is included in the response.
        - `treatments` includes all treatment and parameter details. By default treatment data is not included in the response.

        For example, `expand=draftIteration,treatments` includes the `draftIteration` and `treatments` fields in the response. If fields that you request with the `expand` query parameter are empty, they are not included in the response.

        ### Expanding the experiment response

        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get experiment" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

        - `previousIterations` includes all iterations prior to the current iteration. By default only the current iteration is included in the response.
        - `draftIteration` includes the iteration which has not been started yet, if any.
        - `secondaryMetrics` includes secondary metrics. By default only the primary metric is included in the response.
        - `treatments` includes all treatment and parameter details. By default treatment data is not included in the response.

        For example, `expand=draftIteration,treatments` includes the `draftIteration` and `treatments` fields in the response. If fields that you request with the `expand` query parameter are empty, they are not included in the response.

    patch:
      description: |
        Update an experiment. Updating an experiment uses the semantic patch format.

        To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating experiments.

        #### updateName

        Updates the experiment name.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: The new name.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateName",
            "value": "Example updated experiment name"
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### updateDescription

        Updates the experiment description.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: The new description.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateDescription",
            "value": "Example updated description"
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### startIteration

        Starts a new iteration for this experiment. You must [create a new iteration](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createIteration) before calling this instruction.

        An iteration may not be started until it meets the following criteria:

        * Its associated flag is toggled on and is not archived
        * Its `randomizationUnit` is set
        * At least one of its `treatments` has a non-zero `allocationPercent`

        ##### Parameters

        - `changeJustification`: The reason for starting a new iteration. Required when you call `startIteration` on an already running experiment, otherwise optional.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "startIteration",
            "changeJustification": "It's time to start a new iteration"
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### stopIteration

        Stops the current iteration for this experiment.

        ##### Parameters

        - `winningTreatmentId`: The ID of the winning treatment. Treatment IDs are returned as part of the [Get experiment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getExperiment) response. They are the `_id` of each element in the `treatments` array.
        - `winningReason`: The reason for the winner

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "stopIteration",
            "winningTreatmentId": "3a548ec2-72ac-4e59-8518-5c24f5609ccf",
            "winningReason": "Example reason to stop the iteration"
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### archiveExperiment

        Archives this experiment. Archived experiments are hidden by default in the LaunchDarkly user interface. You cannot start new iterations for archived experiments.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "archiveExperiment" }]
        }
        ```

        #### restoreExperiment

        Restores an archived experiment. After restoring an experiment, you can start new iterations for it again.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "restoreExperiment" }]
        }
        ```

        LaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the "Get experiment results" response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter with the following field:
        * `traffic` includes the total count of units for each treatment.

        For example, `expand=traffic` includes the `traffic` field for the project in the response.

    patch:
      description: |2

        Update a scheduled change, overriding existing instructions with the new ones. Updating a scheduled change uses the semantic patch format.

        To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating scheduled changes.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating scheduled changes</strong></summary>

        #### deleteScheduledChange

        Removes the scheduled change.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "deleteScheduledChange" }]
        }
        ```

        #### replaceScheduledChangesInstructions

        Removes the existing scheduled changes and replaces them with the new instructions.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: An array of the new actions to perform when the execution date for these scheduled changes arrives. Supported scheduled actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.

        Here's an example that replaces the scheduled changes with new instructions to turn flag targeting off:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [
            {
              "kind": "replaceScheduledChangesInstructions",
              "value": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOff"} ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        #### updateScheduledChangesExecutionDate

        Updates the execution date for the scheduled changes.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: the new execution date, in Unix milliseconds.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [
            {
              "kind": "updateScheduledChangesExecutionDate",
              "value": 1754092860000
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

      description: "Create a workflow for a feature flag. You can create a workflow\
        \ directly, or you can apply a template to create a new workflow.\n\n### Creating\
        \ a workflow\n\nYou can use the create workflow endpoint to create a workflow\
        \ directly by adding a `stages` array to the request body.\n\nFor each stage,\
        \ define the `name`, `conditions` when the stage should be executed, and `action`\
        \ that describes the stage.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\
        \n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive rollout starting\
        \ in two days\",\n  \"description\": \"Turn flag targeting on and increase\
        \ feature rollout in 10% increments each day\",\n  \"stages\": [\n    {\n\
        \      \"name\": \"10% rollout on day 1\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n    \
        \    {\n          \"kind\": \"schedule\",\n          \"scheduleKind\": \"\
        relative\", // or \"absolute\"\n              //  If \"scheduleKind\" is \"\
        absolute\", set \"executionDate\";\n              // \"waitDuration\" and\
        \ \"waitDurationUnit\" will be ignored\n          \"waitDuration\": 2,\n \
        \         \"waitDurationUnit\": \"calendarDay\"\n        },\n        {\n \
        \         \"kind\": \"ld-approval\",\n          \"notifyMemberIds\": [ \"\

        \          {\n            \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\n          },\n       \
        \   {\n            \"kind\": \"updateFallthroughVariationOrRollout\",\n  \
        \          \"rolloutWeights\": {\n              \"452f5fb5-7320-4ba3-81a1-8f4324f79d49\"\

        \n### Creating a workflow by applying a workflow template\n\nYou can also\
        \ create a workflow by applying a workflow template. If you pass a valid workflow\
        \ template key as the `templateKey` query parameter with the request, the\
        \ API will attempt to create a new workflow with the stages defined in the\
        \ workflow template with the corresponding key.\n\n#### Applicability of stages\n\
        Templates are created in the context of a particular flag in a particular\
        \ environment in a particular project. However, because workflows created\
        \ from a template can be applied to any project, environment, and flag, some\
        \ steps of the workflow may need to be updated in order to be applicable for\
        \ the target resource.\n\nYou can pass a `dryRun` query parameter to tell\
        \ the API to return a report of which steps of the workflow template are applicable\
        \ in the target project/environment/flag, and which will need to be updated.\
        \ When the `dryRun` query parameter is present the response body includes\
        \ a `meta` property that holds a list of parameters that could potentially\
        \ be inapplicable for the target resource. Each of these parameters will include\
        \ a `valid` field. You will need to update any invalid parameters in order\
        \ to create the new workflow. You can do this using the `parameters` property,\
        \ which overrides the workflow template parameters.\n\n#### Overriding template\
        \ parameters\nYou can use the `parameters` property in the request body to\
        \ tell the API to override the specified workflow template parameters with\
        \ new values that are specific to your target project/environment/flag.\n\n\
        <details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\n_Example request\
        \ body_\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"workflow created from my-template\",\n\t\
        \"description\": \"description of my workflow\",\n\t\"parameters\": [\n\t\t\
        {\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3b\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/clauses/0/values\"\
        ,\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": [\"updated-segment\"]\n\t\t\t\
        }\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3d\",\n\t\t\t\"path\"\
        : \"/variationId\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd12\"\
        \n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nIf there are any steps in the\
        \ template that are not applicable to the target resource, the workflow will\
        \ not be created, and the `meta` property will be included in the response\
        \ body detailing which parameters need to be updated.\n"

        ### Filtering release pipelines

        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:

        - `query` is a string that matches against the release pipeline `key`, `name`, and `description`. It is not case sensitive. For example: `?filter=query:examplePipeline`.

    patch:
      description: |
        Update a segment. The request body must be a valid semantic patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch. To learn more the different formats, read [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Using semantic patches on a segment

        To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        The body of a semantic patch request for updating segments requires an `environmentKey` in addition to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request takes the following properties:

        * `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.
        * `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.
        * `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating segments.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating segments</strong></summary>

        #### addIncludedTargets

        Adds context keys to the individual context targets included in the segment for the specified `contextKind`. Returns an error if this causes the same context key to be both included and excluded.

        ##### Parameters

        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be added to.
        - `values`: List of keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addIncludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### addIncludedUsers

        Adds user keys to the individual user targets included in the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded. If you are working with contexts, use `addIncludedTargets` instead of this instruction.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: List of user keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addIncludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### addExcludedTargets

        Adds context keys to the individual context targets excluded in the segment for the specified `contextKind`. Returns an error if this causes the same context key to be both included and excluded.

        ##### Parameters

        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be added to.
        - `values`: List of keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExcludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### addExcludedUsers

        Adds user keys to the individual user targets excluded from the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded. If you are working with contexts, use `addExcludedTargets` instead of this instruction.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: List of user keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExcludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### removeIncludedTargets

        Removes context keys from the individual context targets included in the segment for the specified `contextKind`.

        ##### Parameters

        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be removed from.
        - `values`: List of keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeIncludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### removeIncludedUsers

        Removes user keys from the individual user targets included in the segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeIncludedTargets` instead of this instruction.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: List of user keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeIncludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### removeExcludedTargets

        Removes context keys from the individual context targets excluded from the segment for the specified `contextKind`.

        ##### Parameters

        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be removed from.
        - `values`: List of keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExcludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### removeExcludedUsers

        Removes user keys from the individual user targets excluded from the segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeExcludedTargets` instead of this instruction.

        ##### Parameters

        - `values`: List of user keys.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExcludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### updateName

        Updates the name of the segment.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: Name of the segment.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateName",
            "value": "Updated segment name"
          }]
        }
        ```

        </details>

        ## Using JSON patches on a segment

        If you do not include the header described above, you can use a [JSON patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) or [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation of the desired changes.

        For example, to update the description for a segment with a JSON patch, use the following request body:

        ```json
        {
          "patch": [
            {
              "op": "replace",
              "path": "/description",
              "value": "new description"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        To update fields in the segment that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Use `/0` to add the new entry to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add the new entry to the end of the array.

        For example, to add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:

        ```json
        {
          "patch":[
            {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/rules/0",
              "value": {
                "clauses": [{ "contextKind": "user", "attribute": "email", "op": "endsWith", "values": [".edu"], "negate": false }]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        To add or remove targets from segments, we recommend using semantic patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific instructions for adding and removing both included and excluded targets.

    patch:
      description: |2

        Update expiring context targets for a segment. Updating a context target expiration uses the semantic patch format.

        To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        If the request is well-formed but any of its instructions failed to process, this operation returns status code `200`. In this case, the response `errors` array will be non-empty.

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating expiring context targets.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring context targets</strong></summary>

        #### addExpiringTarget

        Schedules a date and time when LaunchDarkly will remove a context from segment targeting. The segment must already have the context as an individual target.

        ##### Parameters

        - `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be either `included` or `excluded`.
        - `contextKey`: The context key.
        - `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.
        - `value`: The date when the context should expire from the segment targeting, in Unix milliseconds.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExpiringTarget",
            "targetType": "included",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user",
            "value": 1754092860000
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### updateExpiringTarget

        Updates the date and time when LaunchDarkly will remove a context from segment targeting.

        ##### Parameters

        - `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be either `included` or `excluded`.
        - `contextKey`: The context key.
        - `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.
        - `value`: The new date when the context should expire from the segment targeting, in Unix milliseconds.
        - `version`: (Optional) The version of the expiring target to update. If included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of the expiring target.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateExpiringTarget",
            "targetType": "included",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user",
            "value": 1754179260000
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### removeExpiringTarget

        Removes the scheduled expiration for the context in the segment.

        ##### Parameters

        - `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be either `included` or `excluded`.
        - `contextKey`: The context key.
        - `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExpiringTarget",
            "targetType": "included",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user",
          }]
        }
        ```

        Return a list of teams.

        By default, this returns the first 20 teams. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.

        ### Filtering teams

        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:

        - `query` is a string that matches against the teams' names and keys. It is not case-sensitive.
          - A request with `query:abc` returns teams with the string `abc` in their name or key.
        - `nomembers` is a boolean that filters the list of teams who have 0 members
          - A request with `nomembers:true` returns teams that have 0 members
          - A request with `nomembers:false` returns teams that have 1 or more members

        ### Expanding the teams response
        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "List teams" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.
        * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.
        * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.
        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.

        For example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles` fields in the response.

        Perform a partial update to multiple teams. Updating teams uses the semantic patch format.

        To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating teams.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating teams</strong></summary>

        #### addMembersToTeams

        Add the members to teams.

        ##### Parameters

        - `memberIDs`: List of member IDs to add.

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addMembersToTeams",
            "memberIDs": [
              "1234a56b7c89d012345e678f"
            ],
            "teamKeys": [

        ##### Parameters

        - `teamKeys`: List of teams to update.
        - `filterLastSeen`: (Optional) A JSON object with one of the following formats:
          - `{"never": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.
          - `{"noData": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.
          - `{"before": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.
        - `filterQuery`: (Optional) A string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.
        - `filterRoles`: (Optional) A `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.

        ### Expanding the teams response
        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Create team" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.
        * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.
        * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.
        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.

        For example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles` fields in the response.

        ### Expanding the teams response
        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get team" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.
        * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.
        * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.
        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.

        For example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles` fields in the response.

            "kind": "removeMembers",
            "values": [ "1234a56b7c89d012345e678f", "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011" ]
          }]
        }
        ```

        #### replaceMembers

        Replaces the existing members of the team with the new members.

          }]
        }
        ```

        #### addPermissionGrants

        Adds permission grants to members for the team. For example, a permission grant could allow a member to act as a team maintainer. A permission grant may have either an `actionSet` or a list of `actions` but not both at the same time. The members do not have to be team members to have a permission grant for the team.

        ##### Parameters

          }]
        }
        ```

        #### removePermissionGrants

        Removes permission grants from members for the team. A permission grant may have either an `actionSet` or a list of `actions` but not both at the same time. The `actionSet` and `actions` must match an existing permission grant.

        ##### Parameters

        - `actionSet`: Name of the action set.
        - `actions`: List of actions.
        - `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.

          }]
        }
        ```

        Updates the name of the team.

        ##### Parameters

        - `value`: The new name.

        Here's an example:

        ```json
        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateName",

        ### Expanding the teams response
        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Update team" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.
        * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.
        * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.
        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.

        For example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles` fields in the response.

      description: |
        Add multiple members to an existing team by uploading a CSV file of member email addresses. Your CSV file must include email addresses in the first column. You can include data in additional columns, but LaunchDarkly ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are optional. To learn more, read [Managing team members](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams/managing#managing-team-members).

        **Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the CSV file contains a combination of valid and invalid entries. A `207` results in no members being added to the team.

        On a `207` response, if an entry contains bad input, the `message` field contains the row number as well as the reason for the error. The `message` field is omitted if the entry is valid.

        Example `207` response:
        ```json
        {
          "items": [
            {
              "status": "success",
              "value": "new-team-member@acme.com"
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 2: empty row",
              "status": "error",
              "value": ""
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 3: email already exists in the specified team",
              "status": "error",
              "value": "existing-team-member@acme.com"
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 4: invalid email formatting",
              "status": "error",
              "value": "invalid email format"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Message | Resolution
        --- | ---
        Empty row | This line is blank. Add an email address and try again.
        Duplicate entry | This email address appears in the file twice. Remove the email from the file and try again.
        Email already exists in the specified team | This member is already on your team. Remove the email from the file and try again.
        Invalid formatting | This email address is not formatted correctly. Fix the formatting and try again.
        Email does not belong to a LaunchDarkly member | The email address doesn't belong to a LaunchDarkly account member. Invite them to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.

        On a `400` response, the `message` field may contain errors specific to this endpoint.

        Example `400` response:
        ```json
        {
          "code": "invalid_request",
          "message": "Unable to process file"
        }
        ```

        Message | Resolution
        --- | ---
        Unable to process file | LaunchDarkly could not process the file for an unspecified reason. Review your file for errors and try again.
        File exceeds 25mb | Break up your file into multiple files of less than 25mbs each.
        All emails have invalid formatting | None of the email addresses in the file are in the correct format. Fix the formatting and try again.
        All emails belong to existing team members | All listed members are already on this team. Populate the file with member emails that do not belong to the team and try again.
        File is empty | The CSV file does not contain any email addresses. Populate the file and try again.
        No emails belong to members of your LaunchDarkly organization | None of the email addresses belong to members of your LaunchDarkly account. Invite these members to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.

        Search users in LaunchDarkly based on their last active date, a user attribute filter set, or a search query.

        An example user attribute filter set is `filter=firstName:Anna,activeTrial:false`. This matches users that have the user attribute `firstName` set to `Anna`, that also have the attribute `activeTrial` set to `false`.

        To paginate through results, follow the `next` link in the `_links` object. To learn more, read [Representations](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        List all users in the environment. Includes the total count of users. This is useful for exporting all users in the system for further analysis.

        Each page displays users up to a set `limit`. The default is 20. To page through, follow the `next` link in the `_links` object. To learn more, read [Representations](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        Enable or disable a feature flag for a user based on their key.

        Omitting the `setting` attribute from the request body, or including a `setting` of `null`, erases the current setting for a user.

        If you previously patched the flag, and the patch included the user's data, LaunchDarkly continues to use that data. If LaunchDarkly has never encountered the user's key before, it calculates the flag values based on the user key alone.

    patch:

      description: |
        Schedule the specified user for removal from individual targeting on one or more flags. The user must already be individually targeted for each flag.

        You can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule a user for removal on a single variation per flag.

        Updating an expiring target uses the semantic patch format. To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

        ### Instructions

        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating expiring user targets.

        <details>
        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring user targets</strong></summary>

        #### addExpireUserTargetDate

        Adds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.

        ##### Parameters

        * `flagKey`: The flag key
        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag.

        #### updateExpireUserTargetDate

        Updates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.

        ##### Parameters

        * `flagKey`: The flag key
        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag
        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag.
        * `version`: The version of the expiring user target to update. If included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of the expiring user target.

        #### removeExpireUserTargetDate

        Removes the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual targeting. The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until explicitly removed, or until another removal is scheduled.

        ##### Parameters

        * `flagKey`: The flag key
        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        ### Expanding the chart response

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the chart response to include additional fields.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include the following:

        * `metrics` includes details on the metrics related to deployment frequency

        For example, use `?expand=metrics` to include the `metrics` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        ### Expanding the deployment collection response

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the deployment collection response to include additional fields.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include the following:

        * `pullRequests` includes details on all of the pull requests associated with each deployment
        * `flagReferences` includes details on all of the references to flags in each deployment

        For example, use `?expand=pullRequests` to include the `pullRequests` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        ### Expanding the insight groups collection response

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the insight groups collection response to include additional fields.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include the following:

        * `scores` includes details on all of the scores used in the engineering insights metrics views for each group
        * `environment` includes details on each environment associated with each group
        * `metadata` includes counts of the number of insight groups with particular indicators, such as "execellent," "good," "fair," and so on.

        For example, use `?expand=scores` to include the `scores` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        ### Expanding the pull request collection response

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the pull request collection response to include additional fields.

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include the following:

        * `deployments` includes details on all of the deployments associated with each pull request
        * `flagReferences` includes details on all of the references to flags in each pull request
        * `leadTime` includes details about the lead time of the pull request for each stage

        For example, use `?expand=deployments` to include the `deployments` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.
